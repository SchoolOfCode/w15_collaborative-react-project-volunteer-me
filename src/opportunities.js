        "role" : "Listening volunteers are there for anyone who needs someone. They spend over one million hours responding to calls for help each year and they can change the course of someone’s life.
                Listening volunteers can change the course of someone’s life but many calls to Samaritans go unanswered because we don’t have enough volunteers. That’s where you come in.
                Every day, Samaritans volunteers respond to around 10,000 calls for help. Every day we can help someone turn their life around. As a listening volunteer you get the chance to make a real difference to someone’s future.
                People of all kinds contact us about all kinds of problems. It could be depression, loneliness, stressful situations at home or work, debt, abuse. We listen, give them a chance to get it out, and talk things through with them. Only about 1 in 5 calls or messages are from people feeling suicidal, and the vast majority of these aren’t actively planning to end their lives.",
        "hours" : "Samaritans is proud to offer its services 25 hours a day, 7 days a week. We rely on our volunteers to offer their time to ensure we can achieve this. Listening volunteers typically do one shift of about 3 to 4 hours a week, as well a regular shift during the night so that we can be there for people when they need us, a night shift is only usually 4 - 6 hours every 4 - 8 weeks and the expectation of night shifts is different across our branches. We’ll cover travel expenses so you can get home safely.",
        "skills" : "Open-minded: You’re able to understand someone else’s point of view even if it’s something different from yours.
                Supportive: You’ll help maintain a friendly and supportive atmosphere.
                Empathetic: You’re comfortable with your own feelings and able to share another person’s feelings
                Discreet: You’ll be careful with any information you’re told, and never share it outside Samaritans 
                Accepting: You won’t discriminate against anyone for any reason, including gender, race, sexuality, disability or political views.
                Honest: You’re able to tell the truth even when it’s difficult - for example about the type of support we can offer people, even when they want more.",
        "training" : "Training: You'll be given high quality training to prepare you for the role. This takes place over 5-10 sessions depending on if it’s being run as group sessions face to face or online, along with some digital topics and usually takes place during weekday evenings or weekends. It typically takes a few months before you're ready to start volunteering.
                You’ll also receive ongoing training several times a year to keep building your skills.
                Mentoring: Towards the end of the training, you’ll be given a mentor – an experienced volunteer who will be with you during your first few shifts.
                They’ll give you feedback and support, answer your questions, and help develop your confidence.
                Support: You’ll never be on your own as a listening volunteer. And there’s always time to talk through anything.
                Sharing what’s happened with other Samaritans is a good way of dealing with anything you find difficult. (Our volunteers don’t share anything outside of Samaritans and that’s really important).",
        "benefits" : "You’ll gain a range of new skills and the confidence to use them, including the ability to understand people and manage difficult conversations. 
                It’s always different and always interesting – no two conversations are the same.
                It feels like a privilege to have people confiding in you.

We have social media guidelines for our volunteers which includes asking trainee volunteers not to disclose they are volunteers until they are fully trained. We would therefore suggest that you don’t mention on social media that you are applying to become a volunteer. This protects you from being asked to help someone when you may not have completed the training.",
